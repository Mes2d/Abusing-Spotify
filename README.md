# Abusing Spotify
Well, people did it with OneDrive, so why not with Spotify?


### Handle Hijacking Briefing
Handles is basically a feature that we can abuse. Apps on Windows open a handle to perform tasks or load modules, etc. We can exploit this to our advantage by loading whatever we want using this method. We can hijack an existing handle, open another handle to a different process using this handle, or even duplicate the handle with the same access rights if we are unsure about handle violations. This method is often used to bypass anti-cheats.


### The Purpose of This Project
I just got bored and thought about abusing Spotify since I love music. I also did it for research and learning purposes, so do not abuse it too much.
